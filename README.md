# >> Steam Auto Shutdown <<
This program shutdowns your PC when your steam downloads finish. Actually, it shutdowns your computer if it doesn't detect any network usage for some time, so you can use it with any programs, not only with steam.

# Instructions
- Start your steam download.
- Open the program.
- Click on <b>Toggle Auto Shutdown</b>.
- The program will shutdown your PC when the downloads finish.

# More information
It works with every download that you are doing.
It uses network usage to check if you are downloading something. This will only be accurate if you are not using your computer and if there are no background applications using your network.
